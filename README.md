# Assignment-Create-an-Application-for-Calculating-Permutations-and-Combinations
Calculates permutations and combinations based on user input. The application should allow the user to enter the values for n (total items) and r (items to be chosen or arranged) and then display the results

The application takes two inputs from the user: n (total items) and r (items to be chosen or arranged).
The application should calculate and display:
The number of permutations P(n, r)
The number of combinations C(n, r)

Main.java has the scanner for user input and validation.
MathCalc.java has the method to calculate permutations/combinations, and the factorial calculation used in those two methods
